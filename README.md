# Plant-Disease-Classification

This dataset has been meticulously curated using offline augmentation techniques applied to the original PlantVillage Dataset, available here. The dataset comprises approximately 87,000 RGB images of crop leaves, depicting both healthy and diseased conditions. These images are categorized into 38 distinct classes, providing a diverse representation of various crop diseases. The dataset has been partitioned into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%), maintaining the original directory structure. Additionally, a separate directory with 33 test images has been created for predictive evaluation.

Project Goal

Our primary objective is straightforward: to develop a robust model capable of accurately classifying crop leaves as either healthy or diseased. Furthermore, in the case of disease presence, the model aims to identify and predict the specific type of disease affecting the crop.

Getting Started

Dataset: Download the original PlantVillage Dataset here and apply the provided offline augmentation techniques.

Data Structure: The dataset follows an 80/20 split for training and validation, respectively. Ensure the preservation of the directory structure for seamless integration.

Test Data: A separate directory contains 33 test images for prediction purposes.
